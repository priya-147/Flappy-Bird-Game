Flappy bird is a mobile game in which a player controls a bird’s flight height to avoid
obstacles. Pressing on the screen for a longer period of time allows the bird to fly higher, while
letting go causes the bird to fly lower. This project will bring the mobile game to life using a
video camera to detect a player’s motion, and controls the bird based on the speed at which a
player flaps her arms. The FPGA will render an image of the bird flying through an environment,
and display the flapping motion of the wings according to the player’s speeds.
